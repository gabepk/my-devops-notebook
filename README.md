## DevOps Roadmap 2019

Below you find a chart of a roadmap to introduce DevOps to my dev team, demonstrating the paths that we can take and the technologies that we would want to adopt in order to adopt devops. 
I forked this chart (a [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) project) from [Kamran Ahmedse](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap) and shaped according to my current knowledge (December, 2018).
