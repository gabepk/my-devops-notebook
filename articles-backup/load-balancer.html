<p>The load balancer is a key component of a distributed system, since it&#39;s role is to distribute loads of requets among the servers (or other load balancers) withing the system. This allows multiples nodes to perform the same function and increase scalability of the system in general.</p>

<p>They can also serve as proxies and route requests differently depending on their types.</p>

<p>Since load balancers add an extra layer of complexity, they are more useful in systems that has several node/requests. Otherwise, another approach should do, like Round Robin algorithm.</p>

<p>There are many other characteristis ans pitfalls on load balancers, but for now, that&#39;s all I need to know.</p>
